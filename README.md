# Agile and Scrum Methodologies Planning Lab
Lab Practice for IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Speciliazation

**[Here](https://github.com/users/abuturabofficial/projects/2) is the direct link to related GitHub Project**

This lab emphasise on getting comfortable with following methods in Agile and Scrum methodology:
- Creating a Kanban Board for your project
- Creating and updating user stories
- Self-assigning user stories according to the highest priority on the Product Backlog
- Assigning story points
- Assigning and moving the user stories in the pipeline according to the current status of the story (e.g. In-progress, QA/Review, Done, Closed)
- Working on the insights from the project map, like Burndown chart
- Dealing with the unfinished stories
- Dealing with unimplemented user stories
- 
**Note: The course uses ZenHub for creating a Kanban board for this project, but I chose GitHub Project to achieve the same goal (almost same, as GitHub projects doesn't offer few of the ZenHub features like Burndown charts etc. yet)**
